paramiko是用python語言寫的一個模塊，遵循SSH2協議，支持以加密和認證的方式，進行遠程服務器的連接。
使用paramiko可以很好的解決以下問題：
需要使用windows客戶端，
遠程連接到Linux服務器，查看上面的日誌狀態，批量配置遠程服務器，文件上傳，文件下載等

"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid" and
"friend".  it's a module for python 2.5+ that implements the SSH2 protocol
for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines.
unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical
certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you may know SSH2 as
the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote
shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary
channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel (this is how sftp
works, for example).

it is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is
released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL).

the package and its API is fairly well documented in the "doc/" folder
that should have come with this archive.

Requirements
------------

 - python 2.5 or better
 - pycrypto 2.1 or better

If you have setuptools, you can build and install paramiko and all its
dependencies with this command (as root)::

   easy_install ./

Portability
-----------

i code and test this library on Linux and MacOS X. for that reason, i'm
pretty sure that it works for all posix platforms, including MacOS. it
should also work on Windows, though i don't test it as frequently there.
if you run into Windows problems, send me a patch: portability is important
to me.

some python distributions don't include the utf-8 string encodings, for
reasons of space (misdirected as that is). if your distribution is
missing encodings, you'll see an error like this::

   LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

this means you need to copy string encodings over from a working system.
(it probably only happens on embedded systems, not normal python
installs.) Valeriy Pogrebitskiy says the best place to look is
``.../lib/python*/encodings/__init__.py``.

Bugs & Support
--------------

Please file bug reports at https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/. There is currently no mailing list but we plan to create a new one ASAP.

Demo
----

several demo scripts come with paramiko to demonstrate how to use it.
probably the simplest demo of all is this::

   import paramiko, base64
   key = paramiko.RSAKey(data=base64.decodestring('AAA...'))
   client = paramiko.SSHClient()
   client.get_host_keys().add('ssh.example.com', 'ssh-rsa', key)
   client.connect('ssh.example.com', username='strongbad', password='thecheat')
   stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls')
   for line in stdout:
       print '... ' + line.strip('\n')
   client.close()

...which prints out the results of executing ``ls`` on a remote server.
(the host key 'AAA...' should of course be replaced by the actual base64
encoding of the host key.  if you skip host key verification, the
connection is not secure!)

the following example scripts (in demos/) get progressively more detailed:

:demo_simple.py:
   calls invoke_shell() and emulates a terminal/tty through which you can
   execute commands interactively on a remote server.  think of it as a
   poor man's ssh command-line client.

:demo.py:
   same as demo_simple.py, but allows you to authenticiate using a
   private key, attempts to use an SSH-agent if present, and uses the long
   form of some of the API calls.

:forward.py:
   command-line script to set up port-forwarding across an ssh transport.
   (requires python 2.3.)

:demo_sftp.py:
   opens an sftp session and does a few simple file operations.

:demo_server.py:
   an ssh server that listens on port 2200 and accepts a login for
   'robey' (password 'foo'), and pretends to be a BBS.  meant to be a
   very simple demo of writing an ssh server.

:demo_keygen.py:
   an key generator similar to openssh ssh-keygen(1) program with
   paramiko keys generation and progress functions.

Use
---

the demo scripts are probably the best example of how to use this package.
there is also a lot of documentation, generated with epydoc, in the doc/
folder.  point your browser there.  seriously, do it.  mad props to
epydoc, which actually motivated me to write more documentation than i
ever would have before.

there are also unit tests here::

   $ python ./test.py

which will verify that most of the core components are working correctly.

－、執行遠程命令:
#!/usr/bin/python
#coding:utf-8
import paramiko
port =22
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect("*.*.*.*",port,"username", "password")
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("你的命令")
print stdout.readlines()
ssh.close()

二、上傳文件到遠程
#!/usr/bin/python
#coding:utf-8
import paramiko

port =22
t = paramiko.Transport(("IP",port))
t.connect(username = "username", password = "password")
sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(t)
remotepath='/tmp/test.txt'
localpath='/tmp/test.txt'
sftp.put(localpath,remotepath)
t.close()

三、從遠程下載文件
#!/usr/bin/python
#coding:utf-8
import paramiko

port =22
t = paramiko.Transport(("IP",port))
t.connect(username = "username", password = "password")
sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(t)
remotepath='/tmp/test.txt'
localpath='/tmp/test.txt'
sftp.get(remotepath, localpath)
t.close()

四、執行多個命令
#!/usr/bin/python
#coding:utf-8

import sys
sys.stderr = open('/dev/null')       # Silence silly warnings from paramiko
import paramiko as pm
sys.stderr = sys.__stderr__
import os

class AllowAllKeys(pm.MissingHostKeyPolicy):
   def missing_host_key(self, client, hostname, key):
       return

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
USER = ''
PASSWORD = ''

client = pm.SSHClient()
client.load_system_host_keys()
client.load_host_keys(os.path.expanduser('~/.ssh/known_hosts'))
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(AllowAllKeys())
client.connect(HOST, username=USER, password=PASSWORD)

channel = client.invoke_shell()
stdin = channel.makefile('wb')
stdout = channel.makefile('rb')

stdin.write('''
cd tmp
ls
exit
''')
print stdout.read()

stdout.close()
stdin.close()
client.close()

五、獲取多個文件
#!/usr/bin/python
#coding:utf-8

import paramiko
import os

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect('localhost',username='****')

apath = '/var/log'
apattern = '"*.log"'
rawcommand = 'find {path} -name {pattern}'
command = rawcommand.format(path=apath, pattern=apattern)
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)
filelist = stdout.read().splitlines()

ftp = ssh.open_sftp()
for afile in filelist:
   (head, filename) = os.path.split(afile)
   print(filename)
   ftp.get(afile, './'+filename)
ftp.close()
ssh.close()
